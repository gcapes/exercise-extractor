# Exercise extractor
This is a tool to strip the exercises from a Carpentries lesson.
It is motivated by preparing for delivery instructor training,
and wanting a complete, and up-to-date set of exercises to use for that.

## Usage
`python get_exercises your_local_lesson_repo`

This assumes you have the original repo as a remote repo called `upstream`,
and your fork as a remote called `origin`.
